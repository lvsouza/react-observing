Here is an example of how to use react observing to build a simple counter.

```ts lineNumbers
import { observe, useObserver } from 'react-observing'

const counterStore = observe(0)

const App = () => {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useObserver(counterStore)

  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCounter(counter + 1)}>
      Add +1 in {counter}
    </button>
  )
}
```
