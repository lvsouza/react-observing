description: Use a manual subscription if you have a very advanced case.

> We recommend our hooks for most use cases, [see here](/hooks/use-observer).

## Overview

The `react-observing` allows you to manually subscribe to value changes of an observable object.

In some very complex cases, normal hooks may not be enough.
To work around the problem you can use the `subscribe` method available on any observable object.

### Definition

```ts highlight={4}
interface IObservable<T> {
  id: string;
  value: T;
  subscribe(callback: (val: T) => void): ISubscription;
}
```

## Examples

### Counter

In any react component you can use the `subscribe` of an observable.

```tsx lineNumbers
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import { observe, set } from 'react-observing'

const counterObservable = observe(0)

const App = () => {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0)

  useEffect(() => {
    const subscription = counterObservable.subscribe(receivedValue => setCounter(receivedValue))

    return () => subscription.unsubscribe()
  })

  return (
    <button onClick={() => set(counter + 1)}>
      Add +1 in {counter}
    </button>
  )
}
```
