Observables provide support for passing messages between parts of your application. <a href="https://dev.to/felipedsc/observables-como-funcionam-15eb" target="_black">See more</a>.


## How we work

In order for our state management to work with maximum performance we use **observables**.

The observable pattern allows us to create an observable and pass it as a parameter to any part of the application.
At any time, we can subscribe to future changes to the object.

Once registered in the changes, we start to receive every new value assigned to the observable.
And the best thing about it is that with react, we can generate a new rendering stream only when it's really needed.
