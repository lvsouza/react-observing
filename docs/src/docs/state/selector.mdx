title: selector
description: Creating a new observable object from other observable objects or list of observable objects

## Overview

A selector represents a piece of derived state.
You can think of derived state as the output of passing state to a pure function that modifies the given state in some way.

A selector allows you to generate one observable from several others.
In some cases it will be necessary to have an observable that is derived from several other observables.
This is exactly the purpose of the selector.

The selector is very similar to [transform](/state/transform), the only difference is that a selector allows for several other observables.

If only a `get` function is provided, the selector is read-only and returns a `TReadOnlySelectorState` object.
If a set is also provided, it returns a writeable `TReadWriteSelectorState` object.

### Definition

```ts
/**
 * Build a read and writable selector state
 */
export function selector<T>(props: TReadWriteSelectorOptions<T>): TReadWriteSelectorState<T>;
/**
 * Build a read only selector state
 */
export function selector<T>(props: TReadOnlySelectorOptions<T>): TReadOnlySelectorState<T>;
/**
 * Build a read only selector state
 */
export function selector<T>(props: TSelectorStateGetter<T>): TReadOnlySelectorState<T>;
/**
 * Build a read and writable selector state
 */
export function selector<T>(props: TReadWriteSelectorOptions<T>, dangerousOnUnused?: () => void): TReadWriteSelectorState<T>;
/**
 * Build a read only selector state
 */
export function selector<T>(props: TReadOnlySelectorOptions<T>, dangerousOnUnused?: () => void): TReadOnlySelectorState<T>;
/**
 * Build a read only selector state
 */
export function selector<T>(props: TSelectorStateGetter<T>, dangerousOnUnused?: () => void): TReadOnlySelectorState<T>;
```

## Examples

### Read only selector

```tsx lineNumbers
const mySelector = selector({
  get: ({get}) => get(myObservable) * 100,
});
```

### Writeable selector

```tsx lineNumbers
const writableSelector = selector({
  get: ({get}) => ({...get(myObservable), extraField: 'hi'}),
  set: ({set}, newValue) => set(myObservable, newValue),
});

```
