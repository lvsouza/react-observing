title: useObserverValue
description: Returns a react state from a observable object
---

## Overview

The `useObserverValue` allows easy subscribing to an observable object.
It automates all the manual process that would be needed.

The `useObserverValue` is very similar to the `useObserver` hook.
However, it only returns the state and not a function to change that state.

### useObserver vs useObserverValue

The `useObserver` hook by default returns a state and a function to change it.
When you only want the state value and are not interested in changing it, it is recommended to use this method.
It is simpler and makes the application more optimized.

### Definition

```ts
function useObserverValue<T>(observable: IObservable<T>): T
```

## Examples

### Counter

```ts lineNumbers highlight={6}
import { observe, useObserverValue } from 'react-observing'

const counterObservable = observe(10)

const App = () => {
  const counter = useObserverValue(counterObservable)

  return (
    <p>Counter is in {counter}</p>
  )
}
```
