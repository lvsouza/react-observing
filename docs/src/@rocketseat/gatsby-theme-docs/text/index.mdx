# React observing

React observing is a performance-focused library for state management in React.
Using hooks and state builders, you can build a complex state management.
Keeping your app really fast, this library re-render only a component that need a re-render.

## Build a observable state

```tsx
const Store = observe('value')
```

```tsx
const Store = {
  prop1: observe('value'),
  prop2: observe('value'),
}
```

```tsx
const Store = observe({
  prop1: observe('value'),
  prop2: observe('value'),
})
```

```tsx
const Store = observe([
  observe('value'),
])
```

> To work correctly all properties that are States must be mandatory. [See more](/more/mandatory-properties)


## Hooks

Use one of our hooks to listen for any value changes that happen to your observable.

### `useObserver`

Returns a react state and set state from a observable object.

```ts
const [value, setValue] = useObserver(myObservable)
```

### `useObserverValue`

Returns a react state from a observable object.

```ts
const value = useObserverValue(myObservable)
```

### `useSetObserver`

Returns a react set state from a observable object.

```ts
const setValue = useSetObserver(myObservable)
```

## Each property as state

You can have properties that are states and properties that are not states.
You can do what you want.

```yaml
people # State
-- id # State
-- age # State
-- name # State
-- more # State
---- middleName # State
---- lastName # State
```
Or
```yaml
people # State
-- id # State
-- age # State
-- name # State
-- more # NOT a state
---- middleName # State
---- lastName # NOT a state
```


## Array of states

Each state can be updated separately without interfering with the others.

```yaml
peoples # State
-- [0]
---- name # State
-- [1]
---- name # State
-- [2]
---- name # State
```
